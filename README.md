# WeRateDogs Twitter account data wrangling
In this project I gathered, analyzed and cleaned WeRateDogs Twitter account data. 

You will find the data files and the Jupyter notebook with all the code commented. For to run this project on your own you will need to have Twitter API keys and update them in the Jupyter notebook, you can also skip this step and use the JSON data in the 'tweet_json.txt' file.

There are 2 reports for this project:
- wrangle_report.pdf: This report describes my wrangling process for the WeRateDogs Twitter account data.
- act_report.pdf: This report communicates insights on the WeRateDogs Twitter account data from their first tweet till August 1, 2017.
